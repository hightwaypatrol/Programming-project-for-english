            <h1>Programming language C </h1>
            <p>C is a compiled, statically typed general-purpose
            programming language. It was developed
            in 1969-1973 by Bell Labs employee Dennis Ritchie.
            It was originally developed to implement the UNIX operating system,
            but was later ported to many other platforms.
            C is classified as a medium- and low-level language
            because it works as close as possible to real devices.
            The code in the C programming language is written roughly as in
            assembler, that is, the level of abstraction is quite low.

                    <br>- Gaining an understanding of the basics of how operating systems, system software, and popular software products work. For example, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis.
                    <br>- Interaction with libraries written in C. FFI mechanisms are used for this purpose.
                    <br>- Writing programs with uncompromising performance. Programs written and compiled in C run much faster than in any other language.
                    <br>- Help in learning more modern programming languages. C is based on C++, Objective-C, C# and Java. Knowledge of C can lay the foundation and help in the development of highly efficient libraries and modules.
                    <br>- A necessity for Linux system administrators. Any UNIX system (including Linux) is mostly written in this language. A sys-admin who knows C has a deeper understanding of the OS device, can handle unexpected operational problems and offer more optimized solutions.
